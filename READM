Zabbix-agent-Puppet-Module

This module will install the zabbix agent onto client machines. 
Once you have pointed the module at the machine that you want the agent on, 
you can configure the agent by creating files on the puppetmaster in directory below.

location: /etc/puppet/modules/zabbixagent/files/zabbix_agentd.d/autoConf

This above directory is used to keep all of the authoritative configuration files. In the parent directory that houses the authConf directory, make a directory that is the name of the hostname, pulled from factor, of the client machines that you would like to push configuration files to.

If you are unsure of what your hostname is in facter, use the command below.
facter -p | grep hostname

You will see an example directory named is-joshdev1. That name is the hostname. Within that directory you will want to place symbolic links that point to files within the authConf directory.

Example hostname directory:
/etc/puppet/modules/zabbixagent/files/zabbix_agentd.d/is-joshdev1

Make sure you place your authoritative configuration files within the authConf directory only. That way there will not be duplicate configuration files on your puppet master.

Explanation of configuration files within authConf directory.

default.conf
The default zabbbix_agentd.conf file with the following parameters REMOVED from it:
      Server=
      ServerActive=
      Include=
They are removed so that we can define them on a per-host basis.

activeServerAgentLoopback.conf
File to define the Zabbix active server. This parameter is usually pointed at the loopback. 
      ServerActive=127.0.0.1

serverAgent.conf
Parameter to define the destination address of the Zabbix server.
      Server=<ip and/or DNS name of zabbix server>
If you are using both the ip address and DNS name it is required that you separate them 			with a comma. i.e. Server=10.0.0.1, zabbix-server

serverAgentLoopback.conf
Place to define the Zabbix Server's agent Server= parameter. The agent on the Zabbix Server always points to it's local loopback. 
      Server=127.0.0.1
If you are using both the ip address and the DNS name, is is required that you separate 			them with a comma. i.e. Server=127.0.0.1, localhost

Note: Any duplicate entries within the Zabbix configuration will cause the agent to crash upon restart. 
The basic rule of thumb is that if you decide to make a custom configuration file that has a parameter that is within the default.conf file make sure that 

Example of Custom Configuration
Lets say you wanted to make a custom configuration that sets the Server= parameter for the zabbix agent, because you have multiple zabbix servers and you want to point this agent to a particular one. First, create a file named serverAgent.conf within the /etc/puppet/modules/zabbix_agent/zabbix_agentd.d/authConf directory.

♯ Option: Server
♯	List of comma delimited IP addresses (or hostnames) of Zabbix servers.
♯	Incoming connections will be accepted only from the hosts listed here.
♯	No spaces allowed.
♯	If IPv6 support is enabled then '127.0.0.1', '::127.0.0.1', '::ffff:127.0.0.1' are treated 	
♯ 	equally.
♯
♯ Mandatory: no
♯ Default:
♯ Server=
Server=< Your zabbix server IP address and/or DNS name >

Now create a symbolic link within the /etc/puppet/modules/zabbixagent/zabbix_agentd.d/<hostname> directory.

♯ ln -s /etc/puppet/modules/zabbix_agent/zabbixd.d/authConf /etc/puppet/modules/zabbixagent/zabbix_agentd.d/<hostname>
The puppet module will follow the symlink and add the files that it finds the files that are linked in the authConf directory.
